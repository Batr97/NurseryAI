# NurseryAI
This is our final Deep Learning project related to the plant's growth monitoring for nursery.

The main code that should be launched is Final_code.ipynb. It contains all the necessary information about the training process.
Note that this code has to be launched from the root of Google drive with the preliminarily created shortcut to the folder containing all the data (the link is inside the file).

Additional information.

masks_creating.ipynb is an additional file showing the process of marking up the data with masks. It doesn't need to be launched!
